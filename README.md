# Bot Tok

>**Attention:** Bot Tok operates using the Zefoy and Freer platforms. Temporary interruptions in services such as views, shares, favorites, and others may occur on these platforms. These interruptions are not caused by our software and do not imply a permanent failure. 
We want to clarify that these outages are temporary and services will be restored once Zefoy and Freer resolve the issues. This is important and relevant information for all new Bot Tok users.

Bot Tok is an TikTok Up Bot (likes, shares, favorites and views)
based in node.js, puppeteer and third-party providers (zefoy.com & freer.es).

## Install

>**Attention:** To use Git and clone the repository you will need to have *SSH Public Key*. Take a look at this: [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
Without this you may have problems installing. This will make it much easier to upgrade your BotTok to the latest version available with a single command.

>The following installation commands are provided for each operating system. Execute the command corresponding to your OS and follow the instructions, choose the default values by pressing enter or typing Y as appropriate. At some point during the installation a public ssh key will be generated and you will need to paste it into your GitHub account to continue. You can look in this documentation in the manual installation of your OS at the "Add your SSH Public Key" step for more details. After doing this step you will need to press enter on the tarminal to finish the installation. If everything went well BotTok should open.

#### Windows

üìπ [Install in Windows Tutorial](https://youtu.be/4yvkC38avbs)

```bash
pkg upgrade
apt update
apt upgrade
pkg install proot-distro
proot-distro install alpine
proot-distro login alpine
```

2. In alpine install chromium
```bash
apk update && apk add --no-cache nmap && \
    echo http://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.17/community > /etc/apk/repositories
    echo http://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.17/main >> /etc/apk/repositories
    apk update && \
    apk add --no-cache \
    chromium
```

3. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [openssh](https://www.openssh.com/)
   
```bash
apk add nodejs
apk add yarn
apk add git
apk add openssh
```

4. Add your SSH Public Key to your GitHub account ([more info](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?platform=linux)). In ssh-keygen use the default values (press enter)

```bash
ssh-keygen
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy its content and paste it into your GitHub account in [https://github.com/settings/ssh/new](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new)

![](doc/8.png?raw=true)


5. Clone this repository in terminal (fingerprint: yes)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jfadev/bottok.git
```

6. Install Bot Tok
```bash
cd bottok
yarn install
```

*Note:* To enter Alpine from Termux with [proot-distro](https://github.com/termux/proot-distro) use the following command:
```bash
proot-distro login alpine
```

## Update

#### Windows

1. Run in terminal

```bash
cd bottok
win-update.bat
```

#### Linux

1. Run in terminal

```bash
cd bottok
./ubuntu-update.sh
```

#### Android (Termux)

1. Run in terminal

```bash
cd bottok
./alpine-update.sh
```
*Note:* use `./ubuntu-update.sh` if instead of alpine you decided to use another distro like ubuntu for example.

## Use

Type the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cd bottok
node bottok.js
```
And follow the instructions, solve the captcha in the console if necessary, choose one of the available tasks and let the bot work.

>**Attention:** On Windows you can open BotTok by simply clicking on the `win-bottok.bat` file.

>**Attention:** On Windows Chromium can have the problem of opening multiple windows. We can control another browser like Chrome present on your machine. For this we just need the path to chrome.exe and launch BotTok as follows:

```bash
node bottok.js -b "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\Chrome.exe"
```

```bash
node bottok.js -t 'Up Views' -l https://www.tiktok.com/@jfadev/video/7216697213693529349
```

#### Limit Task Accumulations

Set the limit accumulations value with `-x` flag. The bot will stop when this limit is reached.
```bash
node bottok.js -t 'Up Views' -x 20000 -l https://www.tiktok.com/@jfadev/video/7216697213693529349
```


#### Use Custom Cookies

```bash
node bottok.js -c cookies2.json
```

#### Use Proxy

```bash
node bottok.js -p 127.0.0.1:8080
```
or
```bash
node bottok.js -p http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
or
```bash
node bottok.js -p user:password@127.0.0.1:8080
```

#### Use a Random Proxy from a List

```bash
node bottok.js -s proxies.txt
```

File example:
```txt
202.61.204.51:80
47.91.45.198:8888
user:password@47.91.45.198:8888
user2:password2@202.61.204.51:80
```

#### Filter Proxy from a List by Country
You can see the list of country codes here [country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).

```bash
node bottok.js -s proxies.txt -n US
```
or
```bash
node bottok.js -s proxies.txt -n 'US,UK,ES,IT'
```

#### Use Custom User-Agent

```bash
node bottok.js -u 'Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; CPU OS 8_4 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/600.1.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/8.0 Mobile/12H143 Safari/600.1.4'
```

#### Use Custom Browser

Path to a browser executable to use instead of the bundled Chromium.
Note that Puppeteer is only guaranteed to work with the bundled Chromium, so use this setting at your own risk.

*Linux*
```bash
node bottok.js -b /usr/bin/google-chrome-stable
```

*Windows*
```bash
node bottok.js -b "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\Chrome.exe"
```

#### Run with Visible Browser Window

#### Use Terminal Captcha

If the auto captcha solver has problems you can solve the captcha manually.
You can also view the captcha image at the following address
in your browser `http://localhost:8077`

```bash
node bottok.js -k
```

#### Write Activity Log

Stored in the `activity.log` file

```bash
node bottok.js -o
```
Record structure:
[`datetime`] [`user-gent`] [`session-id`] [`task`] `total` (+`accumulations`) `URL`

![](doc/7.png?raw=true)

Display detailed processing information (verbose) in logs

```bash
node bottok.js -o -e
```

#### Set Minimum Accumulation Limit

If you don't accumulate x views/favorites/shares in 60 minutes it stops.

```bash
node bottok.js -z 100
```

#### Set Maximum Time Limit

If the maximum time limit in hours is reached, it stops.

```bash
node bottok.js -f 24
```
#### Set Initial Accumulation Value

The counter starts with this value. Useful for resuming tasks.

```bash
node bottok.js -i 500000
```

#### Set Retry Timeout Value

The timeout period in minutes before retrying a failed attempt. Useful for controlling the retry intervals.

```bash
node bottok.js -R 5
```

#### Set Comment Hearts quantity

```

#### Connect to an Existing Browser Instance

Open Google Chrome with the flag `--remote-debugging-port=9222`:

```bash
/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

Open with that browser the following url `http://127.0.0.1:9222/json/version` and retrieve the value of `webSocketDebuggerUrl` for example: `ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/e5095d9d-9095-4be8-a418-cd8a3f4f020a`.

Run BotTok with the `-r` flag:

```bash
node bottok.js -r ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/e5095d9d-9095-4be8-a418-cd8a3f4f020a
```

#### Bypass Cloudflare Manually

The Cloudflare bypass on Windows and Linux OS are done automatically but on Android (Termux) you still have to do this process manually. If for some reason the automatic bypass does not work, please follow the instructions below for your OS.

#### Detach Mode

With the `-d` or `--detach` flag BotTok manages to work as a background process opening many interesting possibilities.

#### Multi Task Mode

We provide a batch script in both Windows and Linux versions. This batch process reads from the `tasks.csv` file one task per line and launches bottok background processes with one task, one video and a specific accumulation limit in a loop. The number of simultaneous tasks will depend on the resources of your device. Feel free to modify this simple script to suit your needs. 

**Example of tasks.csv:**

Column structure:
`task`,`limit`,`URL`,`provider`

Limit 0 = unlimited

```
or with custom tasks file path
```bash
./multi-tash.sh tasks.csv
```
